Experiment: White Point Project Experiments in Infinitesimal Pink

Statement of Purpose: Trying to study how light pink acrylic paint dries on cardboard.

Procedure: I watered down some pinkish paint and painted it on the cardboard sample. I let it dry standing up so that the paint would run. I am studying to see how it dries. I will add a thin layer of even more infinitesimally pink acrylic washes.

Notes: So far so good. Not much to say.
