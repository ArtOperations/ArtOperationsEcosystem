# Art Operations Ecosystem
THE ART OPERATIONS ECOSYSTEM (c) 2015

* The "ArtOps" circles represent what  "Art Operations" in the Art Operations Ecosystem. They represent "art practises" modelled as DAOs or "distributed autonomous organizations".
* The "broker_ops" are also DAOs, a.k.a. "Broker Operations". The same goes for the "Art Exchange" which is just an "Art Market", modelled as a "Financial Exchange", also a DAO.
* One can imagine each circle as an "automaton" or "finite state machine" or "abstract machine". The "ArtOps" machines need the "broker_ops" machines to interact with the "Exchange" machine.
* Many ArtOps interact with many BrokerOps who interact with a single Art Exchange, at least that is the simplest setup.
* This began as a system I was modelling for a series of novels I've been writing. It's something that characters in the novel will be building, these interconnected systems of Distributed Autonomous Organizations.
